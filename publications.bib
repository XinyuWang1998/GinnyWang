	abstract = {Heuristic evaluation is an informal method of usability analysis where a number of evaluators are presented with an interface design and asked to comment on it. Four experiments showed that individual evaluators were mostly quite bad at doing such heuristic evaluations and that they only found between 20 and 51\% of the usability problems in the interfaces they evaluated. On the other hand, we could aggregate the evaluations from several evaluators to a single evaluation and such aggregates do rather well, even when they consist of only three to five people.},

Understanding people, their characteristics, capabilities, commonalities, and differences allows designers to create more effective, safer, efﬁcient, and enjoyable systems. This book provides readers with resources for thinking about people—commonly called ‘‘users’’—their tasks and the context in which they perform those tasks. Our intention is to enable you to make more informed decisions when designing complex interactive systems. This chapter thus introduces this argument through example design problems. We then present the beneﬁts and costs associated with understanding the user. Two approaches for understanding users are introduced. The ﬁrst is a framework called the ABCS for understanding, in broad strokes, different aspects of users. The second is user knowledge and action simulation for developing and testing how users approach tasks in more detail. After reading this chapter you should be able to appreciate why it is important to understand users, and the associated beneﬁts and costs of doing so.},

Elements are treated as nodes which are connected by narrative clauses, represented by arcs. By representing complex event sequences as networks, inducing 'narrative networks', it is possible to observe and measure new structural features of narratives. The narratives we focus on are autobiographical accounts of becoming, and being, a Nazi. The substantive idea that we develop in this article is that the observable narrative structure of life stories can provide insight into the process of identity formation. We illustrate our approach to narrative networks by analyzing a single story that, in conjunction with the analysis of other stories, yields a set of insights into becoming and being. © 2000 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.

	abstract = {Narratives represent a powerful and ubiquitous form of communication that influence what individuals believe about the world. While the field of narrative persuasion investigates how narratives affect attitudes and behaviors, it rarely considers structural variables discussed in the field of discourse psychology. This study examines the utility of bridging these fields by testing the persuasive influence of novel science information relative to the internal causal structure of a narrative. Results suggest that information placed at causal locations of a narrative result in greater acceptance of information than the same information placed at noncausal locations within the same narrative. These findings suggest that the within-narrative variable of causality can influence the persuasive impact of information inserted into a narrative. In response, this study identifies a significant source of variance that has thus far been overlooked in studies of narrative persuasion.},

	abstract = {In this article, I employ small stories research as a micro-perspective for the scrutiny of any crisis-related positionings of ‘Greece’ and ‘the Greeks’ that accompany the circulation of news stories from Greece in social media. My claim is that such positionings cannot be fully understood without reference to what stories get circulated, where, by whom, for/with whom and how. To substantiate this, I draw on a particular incident involving the assault of two female MPs by a male MP on a Greek TV breakfast show (June 2012). My analysis will show that the ways in which the Greek crisis is invoked or disregarded and erased in the social media transpositions of the incident are intimately linked with two key-narrative processes, which I call narrative stancetaking and resemiotizations (i.e. video-based or text-based) that involve a rescripting of the initial incident. In both cases, I will show how processes of story making are important for what is signalled as relevant and for how the context of the Greek crisis is made sense of, critiqued and ultimately backgrounded or erased in favour of more personalized and localized interpretations, grounded in the original and the transposed tales and tellings.},

We analyse public addresses made soon after the attacks by the US President George W. Bush, the British Prime Minister Tony Blair and Osama bin Laden of Al Qaeda. Each speaker distinguished ‘us’ from ‘them’ and formulated this distinction so as to justify past violent actions and to prepare grounds for future ones. Bush and Blair both distinguished ‘us’ from ‘them’ in social, political and moral terms, whereas bin Laden did so in religious terms. The categorizations were not done in isolation from each other, but were instead networked. We discuss the relation between membership categorizations, presentations of happenings and violent actions, prior and subsequent and we extend our concept of a ‘dialogical network’.},

Numerous studies have shown the importance of websites with user forums for people seeking information related to health. Parents turn to some of these sites, colloquially referred to as “mommy blogs,” to share concerns about children’s health care, including vaccination. Although substantial work has considered the role of social media, particularly Twitter, in discussions of vaccination and other health care–related issues, there has been little work on describing the underlying structure of these discussions and the role of persuasive storytelling, particularly on sites with no limits on post length. Understanding the role of persuasive storytelling at Internet scale provides useful insight into how people discuss vaccinations, including exemption-seeking behavior, which has been tied to a recent diminution of herd immunity in some communities.},

We argue that the incipient shift from traditional media toward user-driven social media brings with it new media dynamics, relocating the (re)production of societal discourses and power structures and thus bringing about new ways in which discursive power is exercised. This clearly motivates the need to critically engage this field. Our research is based on the analysis of a corpus consisting of over 50 million posts, collected from the forum using custom web crawlers. In order to approach this vast material of unstructured text, we suggest a novel methodological synergy combining critical discourse analysis (CDA) and topic modeling – a type of statistical model for the automated categorization of large quantities of texts developed in computer science. By rendering an overview or ‘content map’ of the corpus, topic modeling provides an enriching complement to CDA, aiding discovery and adding analytical rigor.},

However, we identify a pervasive lack of understanding in existing literature, which raises an important research question: how can we build social capital where little social capital exists? We conducted a preliminary study to explore whether and if so, how, individuals in an economically distressed population with limited social capital use technologies to increase social capital and achieve socioeconomic security. We contribute details about barriers affecting social capital (e.g., difficulties finding and making the right connections and an overall lack of trust within communities). We also suggest ways in which ICTs can assist populations that could benefit most from increased social capital and economic security.},

	abstract = {This article studies “fake news” beyond the consumption and dissemination of misinformation and disinformation. We uncover how the term “fake news” serves as a discursive device for ordinary citizens to consolidate group identity in everyday political utterances on Twitter. Using computational linguistic and network analyses, we demonstrate that over the period of 2016–2018, there is an uptrend in the use of identity language in US Twitter users’ discussions about “fake news,” manifested by the increased frequency of group pronouns in combination with issues and sentiments that boost one’s ingroup and derogate the outgroup. Furthermore, as opposed to the conventional wisdom that “fake news” is a right-wing term, we uncover two disconnected retweet networks surrounding liberal and conservative opinion leaders. Like-minded individuals selectively amplify ingroup messages to claim the power to define falsehood and make group-serving blame attributions. We discuss the theoretical implications of our findings and offer new directions for future research on “fake news,” misinformation, and disinformation.},

8 October 2016 to 20 January 2018 posts related to fake news.
 
explored the longitudinal trends of the frequency of pronouns used in Twitter users’ discussion of “fake news.” --{\textgreater}averaged the number of times each pronoun (“we,” “our,” “they,” “their”) was used per tweet.
explore the contexts in which our focal pronouns were used--{\textgreater}collocation analysis to identify co-occurrence patterns surrounding the pronouns of interest. After removing common English “stopwords,” we identified contiguous sequences of two adjacent words (“bigrams”) that begin with the focal pronouns. Although frequency is the most intuitive way to understand collocations, words can co-occur out of mere chance. Therefore, we used statistical techniques proposed by Manning and Schütze (1999) to test for the probability of a certain collocation appearing in the corpus. For each pronoun, we focused on word collocations which (1) were among the top 20 most frequent collocations and (2) passed all three significance tests proposed by Manning and Schütze (1999) (Likelihood ratio, Chi-square, Student’s t-test) at the p{\textless}.001 level.
 
We used the “compound score” reported by VADER, which is a standardized metric ranging from −1 (extremely negative) to 1 (extremely positive) and calculated the sum of positive, negative, and neutral lexicon scores for each tweet.},

	abstract = {This article extends the social identity model of deindividuation effects (SIDE) by considering the various ways in which relations of visibility to an audience can affect the public expression of identity-relevant norms (identity performance). It is suggested that social identity performance can fulfill two general functions: Affirming, conforming, or strengthening individual or group identities (the identity consolidation function) and persuading audiences into adopting specific behaviors (the mobilization function). The authors report evidence supporting these two functions of identity performance both in intragroup and intergroup contexts. They argue that through these functions, social identity performance plays a major role in the elaboration and coordination of social action. Finally, and building on this framework, the authors consider the ways through which social identity performance can be used in the very construction of social identity.},

We conducted a field study of the most prominent of these, timebanking; a system in which ‘time dollars’ are earned and spent by people providing services for and receiving them from each other. Our study exposed problems with the very metaphor of banking itself, which deter participation. In this paper we discuss how these problems can be tackled with user experience design for systems supporting timebanking. Our design ideas emphasize the personal and social benefits of participation, and avoid such unappealing concepts as debt and neediness that the timebanking metaphor falls afoul of.},

We found that designs informed by the endowment effect and loss aversion theories and which communicated to savers the long-term implications of their asset allocation choices, led users to adjust their behavior, make larger and more frequent asset allocation changes, and achieve their saving goals more effectively.},

We implemented and evaluated these two nudges in a 6-week ﬁeld trial with 28 Facebook users. We analyzed participants’ interactions with the nudges, the content of their posts, and opinions collected through surveys. We found that reminders about the audience of posts can prevent unintended disclosures without major burden; however, introducing a time delay before publishing users’ posts can be perceived as both beneﬁcial and annoying. On balance, some participants found the nudges helpful while others found them unnecessary or overly intrusive.

In the second, they were given a range of individual or group goals for contribution. As predicted by theory, individuals contributed when they were reminded of their uniqueness and when they were given specific and challenging goals, but other predictions were not borne out.

In particular, many recent online games feature persistent collaborative virtual environments (CVEs), with complex social organisation and strong social bonds between players. This paper presents a study of ‘There’, one such game, focusing on how There has been appropriated by its players. In particular we describe how its flexibility has allowed players to develop their own forms of play within the game. Three aspects of There are discussed: first, how the environment supports a range of social activities around objects. Second, how the chat environment is used to produce overlapping chat and how the game itself provides topics for conversation. Lastly, how the ‘place’ of There is a fluid interaction space that supports safe interactions between strangers. The paper concludes by drawing design lessons concerning the importance of supporting shared online activity, interaction between strangers, and the difficulties of designing for play.},

This paper presents the ﬁrst large-scale empirical study that investigates perception of narrative similarity using crowdsourcing. As a dataset we use a large collection of Dutch folk narratives. We study the perception of narrative similarity by both experts and non-experts by analyzing their similarity ratings and motivations for these ratings. While experts focus mostly on the plot, characters and themes of narratives, non-experts also pay attention to dimensions such as genre and style. Our results show that a more nuanced view is needed of narrative similarity than captured by story types, a concept used by scholars to group similar folk narratives. We also evaluate to what extent unsupervised and supervised models correspond with how humans perceive narrative similarity.},

	abstract = {For many applications measuring the similarity between documents is essential. However, little is known about how users perceive similarity between documents. This paper presents the ﬁrst large-scale empirical study that investigates perception of narrative similarity using crowdsourcing. As a dataset we use a large collection of Dutch folk narratives. We study the perception of narrative similarity by both experts and non-experts by analyzing their similarity ratings and motivations for these ratings. While experts focus mostly on the plot, characters and themes of narratives, non-experts also pay attention to dimensions such as genre and style. Our results show that a more nuanced view is needed of narrative similarity than captured by story types, a concept used by scholars to group similar folk narratives. We also evaluate to what extent unsupervised and supervised models correspond with how humans perceive narrative similarity.},

The vector representations of words learned by word2vec models have been shown to carry semantic meanings and are useful in various NLP tasks. As an increasing number of researchers would like to experiment with word2vec or similar techniques, I notice that there lacks a material that comprehensively explains the parameter learning process of word embedding models in details, thus preventing researchers that are non-experts in neural networks from understanding the working mechanism of such models. This note provides detailed derivations and explanations of the parameter update equations of the word2vec models, including the original continuous bag-of-word (CBOW) and skip-gram (SG) models, as well as advanced optimization techniques, including hierarchical softmax and negative sampling. Intuitive interpretations of the gradient equations are also provided alongside mathematical derivations. In the appendix, a review on the basics of neuron networks and backpropagation is provided. I also created an interactive demo, wevi, to facilitate the intuitive understanding of the model.},

The emerging third generation of activity theory takes two interacting activity systems as its minimal unit of analysis, inviting us to focus research efforts on the challenges and possibilities of inter-organizational learning. Activity theory and its concept of expansive learning are examined with the help of four questions: 1. Who are the subjects of learning? 2. Why do they learn? 3. What do they learn? 4. How do they learn? Five central principles of activity theory are presented, namely activity system as unit of analysis, multi-voicedness of activity, historicity of activity, contradictions as driving force of change in activity, and expansive cycles as possible form of transformation in activity. Together the four questions and ve principles form a matrix which is used to present a study of expansive learning in a hospital setting in Finland. In conclusion, implications of the framework for our understanding of the increasingly important horizontal dimension of learning are discussed.},

Yet there has been little investigation into how these families communicate and coordinate in basic tasks like remembering appointments. In this paper we take a distributed cognition approach to studying ten families struggling with amnesia through nonparticipant observation and interviews. Our data show that the families work closely together as cognitive systems that must compensate for memory volatility in one of the members. We explore our participants’ strategies for overcoming these difficulties and present lessons for the design of assistive technologies, highlighting the need for redundancy, easy and frequent synchronization, and awareness of updates.

Networked computers are becoming ubiquitous and are playing increasingly significant roles in our lives and in the basic infrastructures of science, business, and social interaction. For human-computer interaction to advance in the new millennium we need to better understand the emerging dynamic of interaction in which the focus task is no longer confined to the desktop but reaches into a complex networked world of information and computer-mediated interactions. We think the theory of distributed cognition has a special role to play in understanding interactions between people and technologies, for its focus has always been on whole environments: what we really do in them and how we coordinate our activity in them. Distributed cognition provides a radical reorientation of how to think about designing and supporting human-computer interaction. As a theory it is specifically tailored to understanding interactions among people and technologies. In this article we propose distributed cognition as a new foundation for human-computer interaction, sketch an integrated research framework, and use selections from our earlier work to suggest how this framework can provide new opportunities in the design of digital work materials.},

To address this gap, we designed a mobile game called Pirate Bri’s Grocery Adventure, that seeks to improve FL through a situated learning approach to grocery shopping. Our game leverages Self Determination Theory (SDT) to build a player’s competence, autonomy, and relatedness as shoppers are encouraged to develop an understanding of the nutritional beneﬁts of foods and are rewarded for balancing sugar, sodium, fats and ﬁbre in their purchases.},

	volume = {79},
	abstract = {The practices of public surveillance, which include the monitoring of individuals in public through a variety of media (e.g., video, data, online), are among the least understood and controversial challenges to privacy in an age of information technologies. The fragmentary nature of privacy policy in the United States reflects not only the oppositional pulls of diverse vested interests, but also the ambivalence of unsettled intuitions on mundane phenomena such as shopper cards, closed-circuit television, and biometrics. This Article, which extends earlier work on the problem of privacy in public, explains why some of the prominent theoretical approaches to privacy, which were developed over time to meet traditional privacy challenges, yield unsatisfactory conclusions in the case of public surveillance. It posits a new construct, “contextual integrity,” as an alternative benchmark for privacy, to capture the nature of challenges posed by information technologies. Contextual integrity ties adequate protection for privacy to norms of specific contexts, demanding that information gathering and dissemination be appropriate to that context and obey the governing norms of distribution within it. Building on the idea of “spheres of justice,” developed by political philosopher Michael Walzer, this Article argues that public surveillance violates a right to privacy because it violates contextual integrity; as such, it constitutes injustice and even tyranny.},

A lack of conceptual interpretive frameworks makes it difficult to unpack interrelated privacy issues in settings where information technology is also present. Building on theory developed by social psychologist Irwin Altman, we outline a model of privacy as a dynamic, dialectic process. We discuss three tensions that govern interpersonal privacy management in everyday life, and use these to explore select technology case studies drawn from the research literature. These suggest new ways for thinking about privacy in sociotechnical environments as a practical matter.},

In this paper, we outline and explore the limits of a speciﬁc ethical phenomenon known as "dark patterns," where user value is supplanted in favor of shareholder value. We assembled a corpus of examples of practitioner-identiﬁed dark patterns and performed a content analysis to determine the ethical concerns contained in these examples. This analysis revealed a wide range of ethical issues raised by practitioners that were frequently conﬂated under the umbrella term of dark patterns, while also underscoring a shared concern that UX designers could easily become complicit in manipulative or unreasonably persuasive practices. We conclude with implications for the education and practice of UX designers, and a proposal for broadening research on the ethics of user experience.},

They summarize the SCOT conceptual framework defined by Trevor Pinch and Wiebe Bijker and survey some of the methodological and explanatory difficulties that arise with their approach. Then the authors present concepts from organizational sociology and political economy that illuminate structural influences in shaping phenomena of interest to SCOT scholars. These structural concepts can be applied to the study of the design, development, and transformation of technology. The authors conclude that the limited amount of scholarship on structural factors in the social shaping of technological development presents numerous opportunities for research.},

	abstract = {Objective 
        The research attempting to disentangle the directionality of relationships between mental health and functional outcomes after traumatic brain injury (TBI) is growing but has yielded equivocal findings or focused on isolated predictors or isolated outcomes. The purpose of the current study was to use cross-lagged panel and structural equation modeling (SEM) techniques to examine causality between comprehensive indices of mental health (depression, anxiety, and life satisfaction) and functional independence in a national sample of individuals with TBI over the first 2 years after injury.
        Design 
        Participants were 4,674 individuals with TBI from the TBI Model Systems Database.
        Results 
        The SEM, which yielded good fit indices, suggested that individuals with TBI with greater mental health problems at 1 and 2 years after injury had lower functional independence at those same time points. The standardized path loadings for mental health problems and for functional independence over time were large, suggesting a high degree of consistency in mental health and functional independence across 1 and 2 years. In terms of cross-lag, mental health at Time 1 did not exert a unique effect on functional independence at Time 2, but functional independence at Time 1 exerted a statistically significant but quite small unique effect on mental health at Time 2.
        Conclusions 
        This combination of results suggests that functional independence is only slightly more causal than mental health in the relationship between mental health and functional independence over the first 2 years post-TBI, and that instead, reciprocal causality is a more likely scenario.

	abstract = {Computationally intensive structural equation modeling (SEM) approaches have been in development over much of the 20th century, initiated by the seminal work of Sewall Wright. To this day, sample size requirements remain a vexing question in SEM based studies. Complexities which increase information demands in structural model estimation increase with the number of potential combinations of latent variables; while the information supplied for estimation increases with the number of measured parameters times the number of observations in the sample size – both are non-linear. This alone would imply that requisite sample size is not a linear function solely of indicator count, even though such heuristics are widely invoked in justifying SEM sample size. This paper develops two lower bounds on sample size in SEM, the first as a function of the ratio of indicator variables to latent variables, and the second as a function of minimum effect, power and significance. The algorithm is applied to a meta-study of a set of research published in five of the top MIS journals. The study shows a systematic bias towards choosing sample sizes that are significantly too small. Actual sample sizes averaged only 50\% of the minimum needed to draw the conclusions the studies claimed. Overall, 80\% of the research articles in the meta-study drew conclusions from insufficient samples. Lacking accurate sample size information, researchers are inclined to economize on sample collection with inadequate samples that hurt the credibility of research conclusions. Guidelines are provided for applying the algorithms developed in this study, and companion software encapsulating the paper’s formulae is made available for download.},

A section in this chapter reviews some variationist studies which have employed the network concept, and begins by noting that the effect of interpersonal relationships on language choices has long been explored in sociolinguistics; witness Gauchat's account of variation in the vernacular of the Swiss village of Charmey. It discusses some of the major methods and findings of this research, before reviewing two later studies which take it as a point of departure. The chapter concludes by considering the links between mobility, social network structure, and social class.},

Both self-efficacy and self-concept are known to be related to achievement; however, there is a need to untangle the relationship between the two constructs as well as their association to achievement across time to best direct future research efforts. To achieve this research interest, a longitudinal measurement strategy was used to measure chemistry self-concept and self-efficacy for learning and performance before and after achievement measures (i.e., two term examinations) in a postsecondary organic chemistry course context. A reciprocal causation, cross-lagged model best fits the data as a representation of the relationships between these three measures over time as compared to autoregressive, performance effects, and self-belief effects models. Significant paths in the reciprocal causation, cross-lagged model include the first self-concept measure to the first achievement measure as well as from the second self-concept measure to the third self-efficacy measure. Relationships from achievement to each subsequent self-belief measure were also significant. This study demonstrates the ability of longitudinal measurements of multiple constructs in postsecondary STEM educational research to collect nuanced information that is overlooked when pre-measure designs of single constructs are used. In the classroom, an initial measure of self-concept can inform instructors of the likelihood of students to succeed on an initial achievement measure, at which point they may choose to implement some of the targeted intervention strategies from literature.},

While initially this was mostly about textual content, over time images and videos gained popularity, as they are much easier to consume, attract more attention, and spread further than text. As a result, researchers started leveraging different modalities and combinations thereof to tackle online multimodal offensive content. In this study, we offer a survey on the state-of-the-art on multimodal disinformation detection covering various combinations of modalities: text, images, speech, video, social media network structure, and temporal information. Moreover, while some studies focused on factuality, others investigated how harmful the content is. While these two components in the definition of disinformation (i) factuality, and (ii) harmfulness, are equally important, they are typically studied in isolation. Thus, we argue for the need to tackle disinformation detection by taking into account multiple modalities as well as both factuality and harmfulness, in the same framework. Finally, we discuss current challenges and future research directions},

	abstract = {The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic has changed our lives in unprecedented ways. In the face of the projected catastrophic consequences, most countries have enacted social distancing measures in an attempt to limit the spread of the virus. Under these conditions, the Web has become an indispensable medium for information acquisition, communication, and entertainment. At the same time, unfortunately, the Web is being exploited for the dissemination of potentially harmful and disturbing content, such as the spread of conspiracy theories and hateful speech towards specific ethnic groups, in particular towards Chinese people and people of Asian descent since COVID-19 is believed to have originated from China. In this paper, we make a first attempt to study the emergence of Sinophobic behavior on the Web during the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. We collect two large datasets from Twitter and 4chan’s Politically Incorrect board (/pol/) over a time period of approximately five months and analyze them to investigate whether there is a rise or important differences with regard to the dissemination of Sinophobic content. We find that COVID-19 indeed drives the rise of Sinophobia on the Web and that the dissemination of Sinophobic content is a cross-platform phenomenon: it exists on fringe Web communities like /pol/, and to a lesser extent on mainstream ones like Twitter. Using word embeddings over time, we characterize the evolution of Sinophobic slurs on both Twitter and /pol/. Finally, we find interesting differences in the context in which words related to Chinese people are used on the Web before and after the COVID-19 outbreak: on Twitter we observe a shift towards blaming China for the situation, while on /pol/ we find a shift towards using more (and new) Sinophobic slurs.},

This behavior suppresses the spread of weak opinions and affects the evolution of public opinion. Current opinion dynamics models do not fully consider this practice of attitude hiding. Thus, they are unable to reflect the phenomenon caused by individuals keeping silent. To solve this problem, based on online social networks, we propose an opinion dynamics model considering attitude-hiding behavior. Individuals perceive opinion climate based on feedbacks of expressions in history and use it to assess popularity of their newly opinions. They may keep silent and adjust expressible opinions to show obedience to the opinion climate. Experimental results and comparison with two related models indicate that our model can simulate the evolution of multiple public opinions associated with reality. Consequently, it provides a clearer explanation of the law and cause of the evolution of public opinion from the viewpoint of individuals’ behaviors.},

	abstract = {The voter model is a simple agent-based model to mimic opinion dynamics in social networks: a randomly chosen agent adopts the opinion of a randomly chosen neighbour. This process is repeated until a consensus emerges. Although the basic voter model is theoretically intriguing, it misses an important feature of real opinion dynamics: it does not distinguish between an agent’s publicly expressed opinion and her inner conviction. A person may not feel comfortable declaring her conviction if her social circle appears to hold an opposing view. Here we introduce the Concealed Voter Model where we add a second, concealed layer of opinions to the public layer. If an agent’s public and concealed opinions disagree, she can reconcile them by either publicly disclosing her previously secret point of view or by accepting her public opinion as inner conviction. We study a complete graph of agents who can choose from two opinions. We define a martingale M that determines the probability of all agents eventually agreeing on a particular opinion. By analyzing the evolution of M in the limit of a large number of agents, we derive the leading-order terms for the mean and standard deviation of the consensus time (i.e. the time needed until all opinions are identical). We thereby give a precise prediction by how much concealed opinions slow down a consensus.},

In our proposed model, we also consider the scenario where an opinion leader exists. We present a theoretical analysis of opinion convergence and consensus in our proposed model and prove a result on the occurrence of “strong diversity” in opinions. We further show that with the existence of an opinion leader, the model will predict a convergence to consensus. Finally, we show the emergence of a strong diversity of opinions in the population for model-based networks and square networks using Monte Carlo simulations.},

Consumers regularly face this trade-off in purchase decisions. Online product/service reviews serve as sources of product/service related information. Meanwhile, modern technology has led to an abundance of such content, which makes it prohibitively costly (if possible at all) to exhaust all available information. Consumers need to decide what subset of available information to use. Star ratings are excellent cues for this decision as they provide a quick indication of the tone of a review. However there are cases where such ratings are not available or detailed enough. Sentiment analysis -text analytic techniques that automatically detect the polarity of text- can help in these situations with more refined analysis. In this study, we compare sentiment analysis results with star ratings in three different domains to explore the promise of this technique.},

Each individual in the network has a private opinion, which is not known by others but evolves under local influence from the expressed opinions of its neighbors, and an expressed opinion, which varies under a peer pressure to conform to the local environment. We design the opinion sifting strategies which are purely distributed and provide resilience to a range of adversarial environment involving locally and globally bounded threats as well as malicious and Byzantine individuals. We establish the sufficient and necessary graph-theoretic criteria for normal individuals to attain opinion consensus in both directed-fixed and time-varying networks. Two classes of opinion clustering problems are introduced as an extension. By designing the resilient opinion separation algorithms, we develop necessary and sufficient criteria, which characterize the resilient opinion clustering in terms of the ratio of opinions as well as the difference of opinions. Numerical examples, including real-world jury deliberations, are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approaches and test the correctness of our theoretical results.},

	abstract = {In many social situations, a discrepancy arises between an individual’s private and expressed opinions on a given topic. Motivated by Solomon Asch’s seminal experiments on social conformity and other related socio-psychological works, we propose a novel opinion dynamics model to study how such a discrepancy can arise in general social networks of interpersonal influence. Each individual in the network has both a private and an expressed opinion: an individual’s private opinion evolves under social influence from the expressed opinions of the individual’s neighbours, while the individual determines his or her expressed opinion under a pressure to conform to the average expressed opinion of his or her neighbours, termed the local public opinion. General conditions on the network that guarantee exponentially fast convergence of the opinions to a limit are obtained. Further analysis of the limit yields several semi-quantitative conclusions, which have insightful social interpretations, including the establishing of conditions that ensure every individual in the network has such a discrepancy. Last, we show the generality and validity of the model by using it to explain and predict the results of Solomon Asch’s seminal experiments.},

	abstract = {A major challenge for managers in turbulent environments is to make sound decisions quickly. Dynamic capabilities have been proposed as a means for addressing turbulent environments by helping managers extend, modify, and reconfigure existing operational capabilities into new ones that better match the environment. However, because dynamic capabilities have been viewed as an elusive black box, it is difficult for managers to make sound decisions in turbulent environments if they cannot effectively measure dynamic capabilities. Therefore, we first seek to propose a measurable model of dynamic capabilities by conceptualizing, operationalizing, and measuring dynamic capabilities. Specifically, drawing upon the dynamic capabilities literature, we identify a set of capabilities—sensing the environment, learning, coordinating, and integrating—that help reconfigure existing operational capabilities into new ones that better match the environment. Second, we propose a structural model where dynamic capabilities influence performance by reconfiguring existing operational capabilities in the context of new product development (NPD). Data from 180 NPD units support both the measurable model of dynamic capabilities and also the structural model by which dynamic capabilities influence performance in NPD by reconfiguring operational capabilities, particularly in higher levels of environmental turbulence. The study's implications for managerial decision making in turbulent environments by capturing the elusive black box of dynamic capabilities are discussed.},

The approach allows for testing null hypotheses of not-good fit, reversing the role of the null hypothesis in conventional tests of model fit, so that a significant result provides strong support for good fit. The approach also allows for direct estimation of power, where effect size is defined in terms of a null and alternative value of the root-mean-square error of approximation fit index proposed by J. H. Steiger and J. M. Lind (1980). It is also feasible to determine minimum sample size required to achieve a given level of power for any test of fit in this framework. Computer programs and examples are provided for power analyses and calculation of minimum sample sizes. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved) (Source: journal abstract)},

In particular, it can examine situations in which there are several final dependent variables and those in which there are ?chains? of influence, in that variable A influences variable B, which in turn affects variable C. Despite its previous name of ?causal modelling,? path analysis cannot be used to establish causality or even to determine whether a specific model is correct; it can only determine whether the data are consistent with the model. However, it is extremely powerful for examining complex models and for comparing different models to determine which one best fits the data. As with many techniques, path analysis has its own unique nomenclature, assumptions, and conventions, which are discussed in this paper.},

	shorttitle = {Silencing the {Self}},
	abstract = {Dana Crowley Jack offers startling new insights into the roots of female depression as she illuminates why women are far more likely than men to suffer major depression in adulthood. Silencing the Self is the first sweeping overview of depression in women that draws on new understandings of the importance of relationships in women’s lives. Attending closely to what depressed women have to say about their lives, Jack reframes major concepts of depression, freeing them from traditional models that have restricted our ability to listen to women’s perspectives on depression.
Jack weaves these voices of depressed women directly into her discussion, providing new meanings to familiar themes: dependence, pleasing, anger, goodness, low self-esteem. These women clearly articulate a no-win, either/or tension in their lives, a tension between sacrificing their own needs in order to preserve a relationship and acting on their needs and feelings at the risk of losing the relationship. Their stories bring to light the “activity required to be passive”—the way women actively silence themselves in order to cultivate and maintain intimate relationships. To accommodate, they learn to censor themselves, to devalue their experience, to repress anger, to be silent. Examining moral themes in depressed women’s narratives, Jack demonstrates how internalized cultural expectations of feminine goodness affect women’s behavior in relationships and precipitate the plunge into depression. In a brilliant synthesis, Jack draws on myth and fairy tale for metaphors to further the understanding of depressed women.
Silencing the Self makes a major contribution to the psychology of women by drawing from the recent literature on women’s relational self and detailing its relevance to female depression. This insightful approach to the dynamic of female depression forges new pathways to self-change, therapy, and research.},

Partners of self-silencers reported more frustration and discomfort when interacting with the self-silencing member. Although significant actor and partner effects were not found between relationship satisfaction and self-silencing, correlation analyses by gender revealed a significant negative correlation between self-silencing and relationship satisfaction among adolescent girls.

In particular, by a clash between two powerful forces—the producer bureaucracy and the new individualism. It will be a clash of values and opinions; and research will be needed to measure them. However, there are dangers in the way that opinion research will be used, and especially in the way that it will be publicized. The protagonists in the arguments on many social issues are likely to make increasing use of published ‘research events’— that is, over-simplified and superficial figures on public opinion, designed mainly to appeal to the media's need for simple and dramatic news, and thence to affect public policies. In fact, the evidence is very strong that there is a genuine difference between people's private opinions and their public opinions. But the requirements of media contests will tend to force research methods to concentrate heavily on public opinions. The danger is not so much that this would distort social policies (though it might) as that it could damage the reputation of market research in general—especially if, as is likely, the findings of one group's ‘research events’ appeared to be directly opposed to those of another's. One important challenge of the 1980s will be to identify these risks and do something to guard against them. Five simple guidelines are suggested which I hope can contribute to a joint campaign to educate in the proper use and presentation of opinion research.},

Self-efficacy has been defined as students' beliefs about their ability to complete a given task, and it can be affected by a student's positive or negative experience in a course. In this study, students' chemistry self-efficacy in an organic chemistry course and its reciprocal causation relationship with performance in the course was examined using structural equation modeling (SEM). Organic chemistry self-efficacy (OCSE) was measured five times during the semester and students' scores in four term exams and a final exam were used as measures of performance. Five different models were proposed and tested to explain the relationship between OCSE and performance. A reciprocal causation model with an exam snowball effect was found to best explain the relationship between OCSE and performance compared to other alternative models including a reciprocal causation model without the snowball effect and an autoregressive model. This model suggests a significant positive relationship between OCSE and performance throughout the semester, providing empirical support for the reciprocal relationship of these two measures. Implications for research and instruction are discussed in terms of the reciprocal relationship between self-efficacy and performance.},

Using data from 36, four-person MBA student teams from six universities competing in a web-based business simulation game over an 8-week period, we found that both high- and low-performing teams started with similar levels of trust in both cognitive and affective dimensions. However, high-performing teams were better at developing and maintaining the trust level throughout the project life. Moreover, virtual teams relied more on a cognitive than an affective element of trust. These findings provide a preliminary step toward understanding the dynamic nature and relative importance of cognition- and affect-based trust over time.},

	abstract = {In many Western societies there are rising concerns about increasing polarization in public debate. However, statistics on private attitudes paint a different picture: the average attitudes in societies are more moderate and remain rather stable over time. The present paper presents an agent-based model of how such discrepancies between public opinion and private attitudes develop at the scale of micro-societies. Based on social psychological theorizing, the model distinguishes between two types of agents: a) those seeking to gain or maintain a good reputation and status, and b) those seeking to promote group harmony by reaching consensus. We characterized these different types of agents by different decision rules for either voicing their opinion or remaining silent, based on the behavior of their proximal network. Results of the model simulations show that even when the private attitudes of the agents are held constant, publicly expressed opinions can oscillate and (depending on the reputational concerns of individual actors) situations can occur in which minorities as well as majorities are silenced. We conclude that the macro-level consequences of micro-level decisions to either voice an opinion or remain silent provide a foundation for better understanding how public opinions are shaped. Moreover, we discuss the conditions under which public opinion could be considered a good representation of private attitudes in a society.},

	abstract = {Online political astroturfing—hidden information campaigns in which a political actor mimics genuine citizen behavior by incentivizing agents to spread information online—has become prevalent on social media. Such inauthentic information campaigns threaten to undermine the Internet’s promise to more equitable participation in public debates. We argue that the logic of social behavior within the campaign bureaucracy and principal–agent problems lead to detectable activity patterns among the campaign’s social media accounts. Our analysis uses a network-based methodology to identify such coordination patterns in all campaigns contained in the largest publicly available database on astroturfing published by Twitter. On average, 74\% of the involved accounts in each campaign engaged in a simple form of coordination that we call co-tweeting and co-retweeting. Comparing the astroturfing accounts to various systematically constructed comparison samples, we show that the same behavior is negligible among the accounts of regular users that the campaigns try to mimic. As its main substantive contribution, the paper demonstrates that online political astroturfing consistently leaves similar traces of coordination, even across diverse political and country contexts and different time periods. The presented methodology is a reliable first step for detecting astroturfing campaigns.},

However, partisan differences in pandemic mitigation behavior mean that Americans may be especially (in)sensitive to information about behavioral norms depending on the party affiliation of the group in question. In July–August 2020, we tested the effects of providing information to respondents about how many Americans, co-partisans, or out-partisans report wearing masks regularly on both mask-wearing intentions and on the perceived effectiveness of masks. Learning that a majority of Americans report wearing masks regularly increases mask-wearing intentions and perceived effectiveness, though the effects of this information are not distinguishable from other treatments.},

Scholarly research is less conclusive, with studies finding varying effects. This article uses an agent-based model (ABM) of land use, social networks, and household dynamics to examine how extreme floods and droughts affect migration in Northeast Thailand. The ABM explicitly models the dynamic and interactive pathways through which climate-migration relationships might operate, including coupled out and return streams. Results suggest minimal effects on out-migration but marked negative effects on return. Social networks play a pivotal role in producing these patterns. In all, the portrait of climate change and migration painted by focusing only on environmental refugees is too simple. Climate change operates on already established migration processes that are part and parcel of the life course, embedded in dynamic social networks, and incorporated in larger interactive systems where out-migration and return migration are integrally connected.},

However, the take-up of these advances in education research is still nascent. In this article, we review the recent automated text methods relevant to educational processes and determinants. We discuss both lexical-based and supervised methods, which expand the scale of text that researchers can analyze, as well as unsupervised methods, which allow researchers to discover new themes in their data. To illustrate these methods, we analyze the text interactions from a field experiment in the discussion forums of online classes. Our application shows that respondents provide less assistance and discuss slightly different topics with the randomized female posters, but respond with similar levels of positive and negative sentiment. These results demonstrate that combining qualitative coding with machine learning techniques can provide for a rich understanding of text-based interactions.},

This tool can help scholars to make more efficient the tedious task of classifying images and extracting information from them. We illustrate the implementation and impact of this methodology by coding handwritten information from vote tallies. Our paper not only demonstrates the contributions of CNNs to both scholars and policy practitioners, but also presents the practical challenges and limitations of the method, providing advice on how to deal with these issues.},

	abstract = {Researchers from many different disciplines rely on social media data as a resource. Whereas some platforms explicitly allow data collection, even facilitating it through an API, others explicitly forbid automated or manual collection processes. A current topic of debate within the social computing research community involves the ethical (or even legal) implications of collecting data in ways that violate Terms of Service (TOS). Using a sample of TOS from over one hundred social media sites from around the world, we analyze TOS language and content in order to better understand the landscape of prohibitions on this practice. Our findings show that though these provisions are very common, they are also ambiguous, inconsistent, and lack context. By considering our analysis of the nature of these provisions alongside legal and ethical analysis, we propose that ethical decision-making for data collection should extend beyond TOS and consider contextual factors of the data source and research.},

	abstract = {Social media data is increasingly used as a proxy for human activity in different environments, including protected areas, where collecting visitor information is often laborious and expensive, but important for management and marketing. Here, we compared data from Instagram, Twitter and Flickr, and assessed systematically how park popularity and temporal visitor counts derived from social media data perform against high-precision visitor statistics in 56 national parks in Finland and South Africa in 2014. We show that social media activity is highly associated with park popularity, and social media-based monthly visitation patterns match relatively well with the official visitor counts. However, there were considerable differences between platforms as Instagram clearly outperformed Twitter and Flickr. Furthermore, we show that social media data tend to perform better in more visited parks, and should always be used with caution. Based on stakeholder discussions we identified potential reasons why social media data and visitor statistics might not match: the geography and profile of the park, the visitor profile, and sudden events. Overall the results are encouraging in broader terms: Over 60\% of the national parks globally have Twitter or Instagram activity, which could potentially inform global nature conservation.},

We introduce a method for modeling the spatial correlations that exist over a social network. In particular, we model attributes measured for each member of the network as a continuous process over the social space created by their connections. Our method simultaneously models the unobserved locations of network members in social space and the spatial process that exists over that space based on the observed network connections and nodal attributes. The model is evaluated through simulation studies and applied to the importance ranking for a network of emergency response organizations and the physical activity habits of teenage girls. The introduced methods incorporate network data into the spatial framework, expanding traditional models to include this often relevant source of additional information.},

Not only can misinformation cause individual users anxiety and harm, but it can also prevent SNSs from realizing their full potential as trustworthy sources of information. This study proposed and tested an intervention-based strategy that was designed to discourage behavior that promotes the spread of misinformation. Guided by the social cognitive theory (SCT), the intervention sought to modify users' outcome expectations by presenting them with a message that highlighted the negative consequences of misinformation. To investigate the effectiveness of this intervention message, a classical experiment was conducted on-line with 131 college-student participants. In the study's experimental group, the ANOVA results showed that the intervention effectively reduced the total number of “Likes” and “Shares” for postings that provided misinformation. Future development and testing of this SCT-guided, outcome-expectations-based intervention is promising.},

This may be surprising given the potential of linking surveys and digital trace data, but at the same time, it is important to note that the collection and analysis of such linked data are challenging in several regards. The three key issues are: (1) data linking including informed consent for individual-level studies, (2) methodological and ethical issues impeding the scientific (re)analysis of linked survey and digital trace data sets, and (3) developing conceptual and theoretical frameworks tailored toward the multidimensionality of such data. This special issue addresses these challenges by presenting cutting-edge methodological work on how to best collect and analyze linked data as well as studies that have successfully combined survey data and digital trace data to find innovative answers to relevant social scientific questions.},

We find that coordinated, inter-state information operations attract greater engagement than baseline information operations and appear to come online in service to specific aims. We explore these ideas in depth through two case studies on the coordination between Cuba and Venezuela, and between Russia and Iran.},

In this work, we study the relationship between the racist narratives and conspiracy theories that emerged related to COVID-19 and historical stereotypes underpinning Asian hate and counter-hate speech on Twitter, in particular the Yellow Peril and model minority tropes. We find that the pandemic catalyzed a broad increase in discourse engaging with racist stereotypes extending beyond COVID-19 specifically. We also find that racist narratives and conspiracy theories which emerged during the pandemic and gained widespread attention were rooted in deeply-embedded Asian stereotypes. In alignment with theories of idea habitat and processing fluency, our work suggests that historical stereotypes provided an environment vulnerable to the racist narratives and conspiracy theories which emerged during the pandemic. Our work offers insight for ongoing and future anti-racist efforts.},
