abstract: This article concerns the attacks on New York and Washington in September
  2001. We use Membership Categorization Analysis to establish how the key figures
  involved in the conflict represented these events and the participants in them.
  We analyse public addresses made soon after the attacks by the US President George
  W. Bush, the British Prime Minister Tony Blair and Osama bin Laden of Al Qaeda.
  Each speaker distinguished ‘us’ from ‘them’ and formulated this distinction so as
  to justify past violent actions and to prepare grounds for future ones. Bush and
  Blair both distinguished ‘us’ from ‘them’ in social, political and moral terms,
  whereas bin Laden did so in religious terms. The categorizations were not done in
  isolation from each other, but were instead networked. We discuss the relation between
  membership categorizations, presentations of happenings and violent actions, prior
  and subsequent and we extend our concept of a ‘dialogical network’.
