abstract: 'The ability to identify similarities between narratives has been argued
  to be central in human interactions. Previous work that sought to formalize this
  task has hypothesized that narrative similarity can be equated to the existence
  of a common summary between the narratives involved. We oﬀer tangible psychological
  evidence in support of this hypothesis. Human participants in our empirical study
  were presented with triples of stories, and were asked to rate: (i) the degree of
  similarity between story A and story B; (ii) the appropriateness of story C as a
  summary of story A; (iii) the appropriateness of story C as a summary of story B.
  The story triples were selected systematically to span the space of their possible
  interrelations. Empirical evidence gathered from this study overwhelmingly supports
  the position that the higher the latter two ratings are, the higher the ﬁrst rating
  also is. Thus, while this work does not purport to formally deﬁne either of the
  two tasks involved, it does argue that one can be meaningfully reduced to the other.'
