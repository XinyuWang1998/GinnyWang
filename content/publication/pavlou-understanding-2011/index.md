abstract: A major challenge for managers in turbulent environments is to make sound
  decisions quickly. Dynamic capabilities have been proposed as a means for addressing
  turbulent environments by helping managers extend, modify, and reconfigure existing
  operational capabilities into new ones that better match the environment. However,
  because dynamic capabilities have been viewed as an elusive black box, it is difficult
  for managers to make sound decisions in turbulent environments if they cannot effectively
  measure dynamic capabilities. Therefore, we first seek to propose a measurable model
  of dynamic capabilities by conceptualizing, operationalizing, and measuring dynamic
  capabilities. Specifically, drawing upon the dynamic capabilities literature, we
  identify a set of capabilities—sensing the environment, learning, coordinating,
  and integrating—that help reconfigure existing operational capabilities into new
  ones that better match the environment. Second, we propose a structural model where
  dynamic capabilities influence performance by reconfiguring existing operational
  capabilities in the context of new product development (NPD). Data from 180 NPD
  units support both the measurable model of dynamic capabilities and also the structural
  model by which dynamic capabilities influence performance in NPD by reconfiguring
  operational capabilities, particularly in higher levels of environmental turbulence.
  The study's implications for managerial decision making in turbulent environments
  by capturing the elusive black box of dynamic capabilities are discussed.
