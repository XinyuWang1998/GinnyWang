abstract: This study is designed to test a reciprocal causation, cross-lagged model
  of self-concept, self-efficacy, and achievement in a postsecondary STEM course.
  Both self-efficacy and self-concept are known to be related to achievement; however,
  there is a need to untangle the relationship between the two constructs as well
  as their association to achievement across time to best direct future research efforts.
  To achieve this research interest, a longitudinal measurement strategy was used
  to measure chemistry self-concept and self-efficacy for learning and performance
  before and after achievement measures (i.e., two term examinations) in a postsecondary
  organic chemistry course context. A reciprocal causation, cross-lagged model best
  fits the data as a representation of the relationships between these three measures
  over time as compared to autoregressive, performance effects, and self-belief effects
  models. Significant paths in the reciprocal causation, cross-lagged model include
  the first self-concept measure to the first achievement measure as well as from
  the second self-concept measure to the third self-efficacy measure. Relationships
  from achievement to each subsequent self-belief measure were also significant. This
  study demonstrates the ability of longitudinal measurements of multiple constructs
  in postsecondary STEM educational research to collect nuanced information that is
  overlooked when pre-measure designs of single constructs are used. In the classroom,
  an initial measure of self-concept can inform instructors of the likelihood of students
  to succeed on an initial achievement measure, at which point they may choose to
  implement some of the targeted intervention strategies from literature.
