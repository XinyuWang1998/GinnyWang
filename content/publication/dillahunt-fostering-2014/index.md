abstract: 'Past Information and Communication Technology (ICT) literature suggests
  that engaging in meaningful activities with ICTs may be related to socio-economic
  security, social inclusion, empowerment, and increased social capital. However,
  we identify a pervasive lack of understanding in existing literature, which raises
  an important research question: how can we build social capital where little social
  capital exists? We conducted a preliminary study to explore whether and if so, how,
  individuals in an economically distressed population with limited social capital
  use technologies to increase social capital and achieve socioeconomic security.
  We contribute details about barriers affecting social capital (e.g., difficulties
  finding and making the right connections and an overall lack of trust within communities).
  We also suggest ways in which ICTs can assist populations that could benefit most
  from increased social capital and economic security.'
