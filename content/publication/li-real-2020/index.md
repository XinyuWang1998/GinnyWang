abstract: This article studies “fake news” beyond the consumption and dissemination
  of misinformation and disinformation. We uncover how the term “fake news” serves
  as a discursive device for ordinary citizens to consolidate group identity in everyday
  political utterances on Twitter. Using computational linguistic and network analyses,
  we demonstrate that over the period of 2016–2018, there is an uptrend in the use
  of identity language in US Twitter users’ discussions about “fake news,” manifested
  by the increased frequency of group pronouns in combination with issues and sentiments
  that boost one’s ingroup and derogate the outgroup. Furthermore, as opposed to the
  conventional wisdom that “fake news” is a right-wing term, we uncover two disconnected
  retweet networks surrounding liberal and conservative opinion leaders. Like-minded
  individuals selectively amplify ingroup messages to claim the power to define falsehood
  and make group-serving blame attributions. We discuss the theoretical implications
  of our findings and offer new directions for future research on “fake news,” misinformation,
  and disinformation.
