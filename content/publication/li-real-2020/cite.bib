 abstract = {This article studies “fake news” beyond the consumption and dissemination of misinformation and disinformation. We uncover how the term “fake news” serves as a discursive device for ordinary citizens to consolidate group identity in everyday political utterances on Twitter. Using computational linguistic and network analyses, we demonstrate that over the period of 2016–2018, there is an uptrend in the use of identity language in US Twitter users’ discussions about “fake news,” manifested by the increased frequency of group pronouns in combination with issues and sentiments that boost one’s ingroup and derogate the outgroup. Furthermore, as opposed to the conventional wisdom that “fake news” is a right-wing term, we uncover two disconnected retweet networks surrounding liberal and conservative opinion leaders. Like-minded individuals selectively amplify ingroup messages to claim the power to define falsehood and make group-serving blame attributions. We discuss the theoretical implications of our findings and offer new directions for future research on “fake news,” misinformation, and disinformation.},

explored the longitudinal trends of the frequency of pronouns used in Twitter users’ discussion of “fake news.” --\textgreateraveraged the number of times each pronoun (“we,” “our,” “they,” “their”) was used per tweet.
explore the contexts in which our focal pronouns were used--\textgreatercollocation analysis to identify co-occurrence patterns surrounding the pronouns of interest. After removing common English “stopwords,” we identified contiguous sequences of two adjacent words (“bigrams”) that begin with the focal pronouns. Although frequency is the most intuitive way to understand collocations, words can co-occur out of mere chance. Therefore, we used statistical techniques proposed by Manning and Schütze (1999) to test for the probability of a certain collocation appearing in the corpus. For each pronoun, we focused on word collocations which (1) were among the top 20 most frequent collocations and (2) passed all three significance tests proposed by Manning and Schütze (1999) (Likelihood ratio, Chi-square, Student’s t-test) at the p\textless.001 level.

We used the “compound score” reported by VADER, which is a standardized metric ranging from −1 (extremely negative) to 1 (extremely positive) and calculated the sum of positive, negative, and neutral lexicon scores for each tweet.},
