abstract: 'In many social situations, a discrepancy arises between an individual’s
  private and expressed opinions on a given topic. Motivated by Solomon Asch’s seminal
  experiments on social conformity and other related socio-psychological works, we
  propose a novel opinion dynamics model to study how such a discrepancy can arise
  in general social networks of interpersonal influence. Each individual in the network
  has both a private and an expressed opinion: an individual’s private opinion evolves
  under social influence from the expressed opinions of the individual’s neighbours,
  while the individual determines his or her expressed opinion under a pressure to
  conform to the average expressed opinion of his or her neighbours, termed the local
  public opinion. General conditions on the network that guarantee exponentially fast
  convergence of the opinions to a limit are obtained. Further analysis of the limit
  yields several semi-quantitative conclusions, which have insightful social interpretations,
  including the establishing of conditions that ensure every individual in the network
  has such a discrepancy. Last, we show the generality and validity of the model by
  using it to explain and predict the results of Solomon Asch’s seminal experiments.'
