abstract: 'While survey research has been at the heart of social science for decades
  and social scientific research with digital trace data has been growing rapidly
  in the last few years, until now, there are relatively few studies that combine
  these two data types. This may be surprising given the potential of linking surveys
  and digital trace data, but at the same time, it is important to note that the collection
  and analysis of such linked data are challenging in several regards. The three key
  issues are: (1) data linking including informed consent for individual-level studies,
  (2) methodological and ethical issues impeding the scientific (re)analysis of linked
  survey and digital trace data sets, and (3) developing conceptual and theoretical
  frameworks tailored toward the multidimensionality of such data. This special issue
  addresses these challenges by presenting cutting-edge methodological work on how
  to best collect and analyze linked data as well as studies that have successfully
  combined survey data and digital trace data to find innovative answers to relevant
  social scientific questions.'
