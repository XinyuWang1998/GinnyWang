abstract: Public health officials have faced resistance in their efforts to promote
  mask-wearing to counter the spread of COVID-19. One approach to promoting behavior
  change is to alert people to the fact that a behavior is common (a descriptive norm).
  However, partisan differences in pandemic mitigation behavior mean that Americans
  may be especially (in)sensitive to information about behavioral norms depending
  on the party affiliation of the group in question. In Julyâ€“August 2020, we tested
  the effects of providing information to respondents about how many Americans, co-partisans,
  or out-partisans report wearing masks regularly on both mask-wearing intentions
  and on the perceived effectiveness of masks. Learning that a majority of Americans
  report wearing masks regularly increases mask-wearing intentions and perceived effectiveness,
  though the effects of this information are not distinguishable from other treatments.
