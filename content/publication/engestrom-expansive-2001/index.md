abstract: 'Cultural-historical activity theory has evolved through three generations
  of research. The emerging third generation of activity theory takes two interacting
  activity systems as its minimal unit of analysis, inviting us to focus research
  efforts on the challenges and possibilities of inter-organizational learning. Activity
  theory and its concept of expansive learning are examined with the help of four
  questions: 1. Who are the subjects of learning? 2. Why do they learn? 3. What do
  they learn? 4. How do they learn? Five central principles of activity theory are
  presented, namely activity system as unit of analysis, multi-voicedness of activity,
  historicity of activity, contradictions as driving force of change in activity,
  and expansive cycles as possible form of transformation in activity. Together the
  four questions and ve principles form a matrix which is used to present a study
  of expansive learning in a hospital setting in Finland. In conclusion, implications
  of the framework for our understanding of the increasingly important horizontal
  dimension of learning are discussed.'
