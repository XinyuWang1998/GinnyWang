abstract: A computer simulation modeled the change of attitudes in a population resulting
  from the interactive, reciprocal, and recursive operation of B. Latané's (see record
  1982-01296-001) theory of social impact, which specifies principles underlying how
  individuals are affected by their social environment. Surprisingly, several macrolevel
  phenomena emerged from the simple operation of this microlevel theory, including
  an incomplete polarization of opinions reaching a stable equilibrium, with coherent
  minority subgroups managing to exist near the margins of the whole population. Computer
  simulations, neglected in group dynamics for 20 years, may, as in modern physics,
  help determine the extent to which group-level phenomena result from individual-level
  processes. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)
