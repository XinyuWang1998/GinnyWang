abstract: Interest in critical scholarship that engages with the complexity of user
  experience (UX) practice is rapidly expanding, yet the vocabulary for describing
  and assessing criticality in practice is currently lacking. In this paper, we outline
  and explore the limits of a speciﬁc ethical phenomenon known as \"dark patterns,\"
  where user value is supplanted in favor of shareholder value. We assembled a corpus
  of examples of practitioner-identiﬁed dark patterns and performed a content analysis
  to determine the ethical concerns contained in these examples. This analysis revealed
  a wide range of ethical issues raised by practitioners that were frequently conﬂated
  under the umbrella term of dark patterns, while also underscoring a shared concern
  that UX designers could easily become complicit in manipulative or unreasonably
  persuasive practices. We conclude with implications for the education and practice
  of UX designers, and a proposal for broadening research on the ethics of user experience.
