abstract: Although information visualization (infovis) technologies have proven indispensable
  tools for making sense of complex data, wide-spread deployment has yet to take hold,
  as successful infovis applications are often difficult to author and require domain-specific
  customization. To address these issues, we have created prefuse, a software framework
  for creating dynamic visualizations of both structured and unstructured data. prefuse
  provides theoretically-motivated abstractions for the design of a wide range of
  visualization applications, enabling programmers to string together desired components
  quickly to create and customize working visualizations. To evaluate prefuse we have
  built both existing and novel visualizations testing the toolkit's flexibility and
  performance, and have run usability studies and usage surveys finding that programmers
  find the toolkit usable and effective.
