 abstract = {Drawing upon social identity and status characteristic theories, we examine the reactions of vertical dyad members to shared dialect group identity in Taiwan. Supervisors and subordinates in 179 vertical dyads independently reported their dialect group identity and their perceptions of leader–member exchange (LMX) and self-disclosure. Results indicate that subordinates reported a more positive LMX with, and greater self-disclosure to, supervisors who shared their dialect group identity. Supervisors reported greater self-disclosure to subordinates with the same dialect group identity, but not a more positive LMX. We also discuss implications for organizational demography theory and research.},
