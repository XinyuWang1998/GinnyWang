abstract: Drawing upon social identity and status characteristic theories, we examine
  the reactions of vertical dyad members to shared dialect group identity in Taiwan.
  Supervisors and subordinates in 179 vertical dyads independently reported their
  dialect group identity and their perceptions of leader–member exchange (LMX) and
  self-disclosure. Results indicate that subordinates reported a more positive LMX
  with, and greater self-disclosure to, supervisors who shared their dialect group
  identity. Supervisors reported greater self-disclosure to subordinates with the
  same dialect group identity, but not a more positive LMX. We also discuss implications
  for organizational demography theory and research.
