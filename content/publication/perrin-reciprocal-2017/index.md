abstract: 'Objective  The research attempting to disentangle the directionality of
  relationships between mental health and functional outcomes after traumatic brain
  injury (TBI) is growing but has yielded equivocal findings or focused on isolated
  predictors or isolated outcomes. The purpose of the current study was to use cross-lagged
  panel and structural equation modeling (SEM) techniques to examine causality between
  comprehensive indices of mental health (depression, anxiety, and life satisfaction)
  and functional independence in a national sample of individuals with TBI over the
  first 2 years after injury. Design  Participants were 4,674 individuals with TBI
  from the TBI Model Systems Database. Results  The SEM, which yielded good fit indices,
  suggested that individuals with TBI with greater mental health problems at 1 and
  2 years after injury had lower functional independence at those same time points.
  The standardized path loadings for mental health problems and for functional independence
  over time were large, suggesting a high degree of consistency in mental health and
  functional independence across 1 and 2 years. In terms of cross-lag, mental health
  at Time 1 did not exert a unique effect on functional independence at Time 2, but
  functional independence at Time 1 exerted a statistically significant but quite
  small unique effect on mental health at Time 2. Conclusions  This combination of
  results suggests that functional independence is only slightly more causal than
  mental health in the relationship between mental health and functional independence
  over the first 2 years post-TBI, and that instead, reciprocal causality is a more
  likely scenario. To Claim CME Credits  Complete the self-assessment activity and

  of this article, the reader should be able to: (1) understand the nature of the
  relationship between mental health problems and functional independence after traumatic
  brain injury; (2) learn about a novel methodological technique for examining the
  connections between variables over time; and (3) understand when ongoing support
  for individuals with traumatic brain injury is necessary. Level  Advanced Accreditation
