abstract: Self-efficacy is an affective learning outcome that has been associated
  with academic performance and retention in STEM. Self-efficacy has been defined
  as students' beliefs about their ability to complete a given task, and it can be
  affected by a student's positive or negative experience in a course. In this study,
  students' chemistry self-efficacy in an organic chemistry course and its reciprocal
  causation relationship with performance in the course was examined using structural
  equation modeling (SEM). Organic chemistry self-efficacy (OCSE) was measured five
  times during the semester and students' scores in four term exams and a final exam
  were used as measures of performance. Five different models were proposed and tested
  to explain the relationship between OCSE and performance. A reciprocal causation
  model with an exam snowball effect was found to best explain the relationship between
  OCSE and performance compared to other alternative models including a reciprocal
  causation model without the snowball effect and an autoregressive model. This model
  suggests a significant positive relationship between OCSE and performance throughout
  the semester, providing empirical support for the reciprocal relationship of these
  two measures. Implications for research and instruction are discussed in terms of
  the reciprocal relationship between self-efficacy and performance.
