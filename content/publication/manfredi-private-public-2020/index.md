abstract: 'In many Western societies there are rising concerns about increasing polarization
  in public debate. However, statistics on private attitudes paint a different picture:
  the average attitudes in societies are more moderate and remain rather stable over
  time. The present paper presents an agent-based model of how such discrepancies
  between public opinion and private attitudes develop at the scale of micro-societies.
  Based on social psychological theorizing, the model distinguishes between two types
  of agents: a) those seeking to gain or maintain a good reputation and status, and
  b) those seeking to promote group harmony by reaching consensus. We characterized
  these different types of agents by different decision rules for either voicing their
  opinion or remaining silent, based on the behavior of their proximal network. Results
  of the model simulations show that even when the private attitudes of the agents
  are held constant, publicly expressed opinions can oscillate and (depending on the
  reputational concerns of individual actors) situations can occur in which minorities
  as well as majorities are silenced. We conclude that the macro-level consequences
  of micro-level decisions to either voice an opinion or remain silent provide a foundation
  for better understanding how public opinions are shaped. Moreover, we discuss the
  conditions under which public opinion could be considered a good representation
  of private attitudes in a society.'
