abstract: We investigate the role of homophily – a tendency to interact with similar
  individuals–in the diffusion of political information in social networks. We develop
  a model predicting disproportionate exposure to like-minded information and that
  larger groups have more connections and are exposed to more information. To test
  these hypotheses, we use data on links and communications between politically-engaged
  Twitter users. We find that users affiliated with majority political groups, relative
  to the minority group, have more connections, are exposed to more information, and
  are exposed to information more quickly. Likewise, we find that users are disproportionately
  exposed to like-minded information and that information reaches like-minded users
  more quickly.
