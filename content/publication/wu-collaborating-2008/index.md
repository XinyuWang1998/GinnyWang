abstract: Individuals with cognitive deficits and their families are prime examples
  of collaborative “systems” that seek to perform everyday tasks together. Yet there
  has been little investigation into how these families communicate and coordinate
  in basic tasks like remembering appointments. In this paper we take a distributed
  cognition approach to studying ten families struggling with amnesia through nonparticipant
  observation and interviews. Our data show that the families work closely together
  as cognitive systems that must compensate for memory volatility in one of the members.
  We explore our participants’ strategies for overcoming these difficulties and present
  lessons for the design of assistive technologies, highlighting the need for redundancy,
  easy and frequent synchronization, and awareness of updates. We conclude with implications
  for distributed cognition theory.
