abstract: We empirically examine the dynamic nature of trust and the differences between
  high- and low-performing virtual teams in the changing patterns in cognition- and
  affect-based trust over time (early, middle, and late stages of project). Using
  data from 36, four-person MBA student teams from six universities competing in a
  web-based business simulation game over an 8-week period, we found that both high-
  and low-performing teams started with similar levels of trust in both cognitive
  and affective dimensions. However, high-performing teams were better at developing
  and maintaining the trust level throughout the project life. Moreover, virtual teams
  relied more on a cognitive than an affective element of trust. These findings provide
  a preliminary step toward understanding the dynamic nature and relative importance
  of cognition- and affect-based trust over time.
