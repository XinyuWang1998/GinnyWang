abstract: An individual's social network is straightforwardly the aggregate of relationships
  contracted with others, and social network analysis examines the differing structures
  and properties of these relationships. Sensitivity to aspects of speaker agency,
  attitude, or orientation aligns social network analysis somewhat more closely with
  the communities of practice model, although social network accounts of groups or
  communities are generally rather more abstractâ€”referring. A section in this chapter
  reviews some variationist studies which have employed the network concept, and begins
  by noting that the effect of interpersonal relationships on language choices has
  long been explored in sociolinguistics; witness Gauchat's account of variation in
  the vernacular of the Swiss village of Charmey. It discusses some of the major methods
  and findings of this research, before reviewing two later studies which take it
  as a point of departure. The chapter concludes by considering the links between
  mobility, social network structure, and social class.
