 abstract = {An individual's social network is straightforwardly the aggregate of relationships contracted with others, and social network analysis examines the differing structures and properties of these relationships. Sensitivity to aspects of speaker agency, attitude, or orientation aligns social network analysis somewhat more closely with the communities of practice model, although social network accounts of groups or communities are generally rather more abstractâ€”referring. A section in this chapter reviews some variationist studies which have employed the network concept, and begins by noting that the effect of interpersonal relationships on language choices has long been explored in sociolinguistics; witness Gauchat's account of variation in the vernacular of the Swiss village of Charmey. It discusses some of the major methods and findings of this research, before reviewing two later studies which take it as a point of departure. The chapter concludes by considering the links between mobility, social network structure, and social class.},
