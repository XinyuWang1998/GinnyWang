abstract: Anecdotal evidence and scholarly research have shown that Internet users
  may regret some of their online disclosures. To help individuals avoid such regrets,
  we designed two modiﬁcations to the Facebook web interface that nudge users to consider
  the content and audience of their online disclosures more carefully. We implemented
  and evaluated these two nudges in a 6-week ﬁeld trial with 28 Facebook users. We
  analyzed participants’ interactions with the nudges, the content of their posts,
  and opinions collected through surveys. We found that reminders about the audience
  of posts can prevent unintended disclosures without major burden; however, introducing
  a time delay before publishing users’ posts can be perceived as both beneﬁcial and
  annoying. On balance, some participants found the nudges helpful while others found
  them unnecessary or overly intrusive. We discuss implications and challenges for
  designing and evaluating systems to assist users with online disclosures.
