abstract: 'Background: Social media offer an unprecedented opportunity to explore
  how people talk about health care at a very large scale. Numerous studies have shown
  the importance of websites with user forums for people seeking information related
  to health. Parents turn to some of these sites, colloquially referred to as “mommy
  blogs,” to share concerns about children’s health care, including vaccination. Although
  substantial work has considered the role of social media, particularly Twitter,
  in discussions of vaccination and other health care–related issues, there has been
  little work on describing the underlying structure of these discussions and the
  role of persuasive storytelling, particularly on sites with no limits on post length.
  Understanding the role of persuasive storytelling at Internet scale provides useful
  insight into how people discuss vaccinations, including exemption-seeking behavior,
  which has been tied to a recent diminution of herd immunity in some communities.'
