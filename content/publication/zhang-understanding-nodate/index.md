abstract: ASPI’s International Cyber Policy Centre has launched the Understanding
  Global Disinformation and Information Operations website alongside this companion
  paper. The site provides a visual breakdown of the publically-available data from
  state-linked information operations on social media. ASPI’s Information Operations
  and Disinformation team has analysed each of the data sets in Twitter’s Information
  Operations archive to provide a longitudinal analysis of how each state’s willingness,
  capability and intent has evolved over time.
