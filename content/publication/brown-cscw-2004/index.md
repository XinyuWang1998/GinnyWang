abstract: 'Video games are of increasing importance, both as a cultural phenomenon
  and as an application of collaborative technology. In particular, many recent online
  games feature persistent collaborative virtual environments (CVEs), with complex
  social organisation and strong social bonds between players. This paper presents
  a study of ‘There’, one such game, focusing on how There has been appropriated by
  its players. In particular we describe how its flexibility has allowed players to
  develop their own forms of play within the game. Three aspects of There are discussed:
  first, how the environment supports a range of social activities around objects.
  Second, how the chat environment is used to produce overlapping chat and how the
  game itself provides topics for conversation. Lastly, how the ‘place’ of There is
  a fluid interaction space that supports safe interactions between strangers. The
  paper concludes by drawing design lessons concerning the importance of supporting
  shared online activity, interaction between strangers, and the difficulties of designing
  for play.'
