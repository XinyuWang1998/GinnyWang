abstract: Recent advances in computational linguistics and the social sciences have
  created new opportunities for the education research community to analyze relevant
  large-scale text data. However, the take-up of these advances in education research
  is still nascent. In this article, we review the recent automated text methods relevant
  to educational processes and determinants. We discuss both lexical-based and supervised
  methods, which expand the scale of text that researchers can analyze, as well as
  unsupervised methods, which allow researchers to discover new themes in their data.
  To illustrate these methods, we analyze the text interactions from a field experiment
  in the discussion forums of online classes. Our application shows that respondents
  provide less assistance and discuss slightly different topics with the randomized
  female posters, but respond with similar levels of positive and negative sentiment.
  These results demonstrate that combining qualitative coding with machine learning
  techniques can provide for a rich understanding of text-based interactions.
