abstract: This article proposes an opinion formation model featuring both a private
  and an expressed opinion for a given topic over dynamical networks. Each individual
  in the network has a private opinion, which is not known by others but evolves under
  local influence from the expressed opinions of its neighbors, and an expressed opinion,
  which varies under a peer pressure to conform to the local environment. We design
  the opinion sifting strategies which are purely distributed and provide resilience
  to a range of adversarial environment involving locally and globally bounded threats
  as well as malicious and Byzantine individuals. We establish the sufficient and
  necessary graph-theoretic criteria for normal individuals to attain opinion consensus
  in both directed-fixed and time-varying networks. Two classes of opinion clustering
  problems are introduced as an extension. By designing the resilient opinion separation
  algorithms, we develop necessary and sufficient criteria, which characterize the
  resilient opinion clustering in terms of the ratio of opinions as well as the difference
  of opinions. Numerical examples, including real-world jury deliberations, are presented
  to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approaches and test the correctness
  of our theoretical results.
