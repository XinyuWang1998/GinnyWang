abstract: 'The creation, dissemination, and consumption of disinformation and fabricated
  content on social media is a growing concern, especially with the ease of access
  to such sources, and the lack of awareness of the existence of such false information.
  In this article, we present an overview of the techniques explored to date for the
  combating of disinformation with various forms. We introduce different forms of
  disinformation, discuss factors related to the spread of disinformation, elaborate
  on the inherent challenges in detecting disinformation, and show some approaches
  to mitigating disinformation via education, research, and collaboration. Looking
  ahead, we present some promising future research directions on disinformation. This
