abstract: "This paper considers the problem of automatically characterizing biases
  that may be associated with emerging information operations via artificial intelligence.
  Accurate analysis of these emerging topics usually requires laborious, manual analysis
  by experts to annotate millions of tweets to identify biases in new topics. We introduce
  adaptations of the Word Embedding Association Test [1] to a new domain: information
  operations. We validate our method using known information operation-related tweets
  from Twitter's Transparency Reports, and we perform a case study on the COVID-19
  pandemic to evaluate our method's performance on non-labeled Twitter data, demonstrating
  its usability in emerging domains."
