abstract: It is noted in the psychology literature that a discrepancy may exist between
  individuals’ implicit opinions and their explicit opinions (or beliefs) on a matter
  due to political correctness or peer pressures. This study proposes an adaptation
  of the Deffuant–Weisbuch model that incorporates both implicit and explicit opinions
  to investigate the evolution of opinions in a population. In our proposed model,
  we also consider the scenario where an opinion leader exists. We present a theoretical
  analysis of opinion convergence and consensus in our proposed model and prove a
  result on the occurrence of “strong diversity” in opinions. We further show that
  with the existence of an opinion leader, the model will predict a convergence to
  consensus. Finally, we show the emergence of a strong diversity of opinions in the
  population for model-based networks and square networks using Monte Carlo simulations.
