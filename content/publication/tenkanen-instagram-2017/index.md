abstract: 'Social media data is increasingly used as a proxy for human activity in
  different environments, including protected areas, where collecting visitor information
  is often laborious and expensive, but important for management and marketing. Here,
  we compared data from Instagram, Twitter and Flickr, and assessed systematically
  how park popularity and temporal visitor counts derived from social media data perform
  against high-precision visitor statistics in 56 national parks in Finland and South
  Africa in 2014. We show that social media activity is highly associated with park
  popularity, and social media-based monthly visitation patterns match relatively
  well with the official visitor counts. However, there were considerable differences
  between platforms as Instagram clearly outperformed Twitter and Flickr. Furthermore,
  we show that social media data tend to perform better in more visited parks, and
  should always be used with caution. Based on stakeholder discussions we identified
  potential reasons why social media data and visitor statistics might not match:
  the geography and profile of the park, the visitor profile, and sudden events. Overall
  the results are encouraging in broader terms: Over 60% of the national parks globally
  have Twitter or Instagram activity, which could potentially inform global nature
  conservation.'
