abstract: Although scholarship in the social construction of technology (SCOT) has
  contributed much to illuminating technological development, most work using this
  theoretical approach is committed to an agency-centered approach. SCOT scholars
  have made only limited contributions to illustrating the influence of social structures.
  In this article, the authors argue for the importance of structural concepts to
  understanding technological development. They summarize the SCOT conceptual framework
  defined by Trevor Pinch and Wiebe Bijker and survey some of the methodological and
  explanatory difficulties that arise with their approach. Then the authors present
  concepts from organizational sociology and political economy that illuminate structural
  influences in shaping phenomena of interest to SCOT scholars. These structural concepts
  can be applied to the study of the design, development, and transformation of technology.
  The authors conclude that the limited amount of scholarship on structural factors
  in the social shaping of technological development presents numerous opportunities
  for research.
