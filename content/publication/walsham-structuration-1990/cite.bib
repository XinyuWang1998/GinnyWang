 abstract = {Research on the social and organizational aspects of information systems often lacks an adequate theoretical and methodological basis. In this paper, we propose that structuration theory provides a broad conception of social action and human society which can be used as the basis for empiricallyorientated theory and research. A critique is given of some published work, which makes use of the theory, on the introduction of new technology and group decision support systems. A categorization of the use of structuration theory in IS research is proposed and new application areas are identified and discussed, including design and development, strategy formation, user resistance to implementation, and the informating aspects of information systems.},
