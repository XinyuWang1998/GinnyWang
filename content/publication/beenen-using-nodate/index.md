abstract: Under-contribution is a problem for many online communities. Social psychology
  theories of social loafing and goal-setting can provide mid-level design principles
  to address this problem. We tested the design principles in two field experiments.
  In one, members of an online movie recommender community were reminded of the uniqueness
  of their contributions and the benefits that follow from them. In the second, they
  were given a range of individual or group goals for contribution. As predicted by
  theory, individuals contributed when they were reminded of their uniqueness and
  when they were given specific and challenging goals, but other predictions were
  not borne out. The paper ends with suggestions and challenges for mining social
  science theories as well as implications for design.
