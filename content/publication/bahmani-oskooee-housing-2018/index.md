abstract: Through its inflationary effects, exchange rate changes could affect house
  prices. On the other hand, rising house prices could have a wealth effect on consumption
  and imports, inducing an increase in demand for foreign exchange. We apply a bootstrap
  multivariate panel Granger causality test to examine the causal relationship between
  house prices and real effective exchange rates across 18 OECD countries. After accounting
  for both dependency and heterogeneity across these countries, we find support for
  house prices causing exchange rate changes in half of the countries in our sample
  and exchange rates causing house price changes in another half. (C) 2018 Economic
