abstract: Online political astroturfing—hidden information campaigns in which a political
  actor mimics genuine citizen behavior by incentivizing agents to spread information
  online—has become prevalent on social media. Such inauthentic information campaigns
  threaten to undermine the Internet’s promise to more equitable participation in
  public debates. We argue that the logic of social behavior within the campaign bureaucracy
  and principal–agent problems lead to detectable activity patterns among the campaign’s
  social media accounts. Our analysis uses a network-based methodology to identify
  such coordination patterns in all campaigns contained in the largest publicly available
  database on astroturfing published by Twitter. On average, 74% of the involved accounts
  in each campaign engaged in a simple form of coordination that we call co-tweeting
  and co-retweeting. Comparing the astroturfing accounts to various systematically
  constructed comparison samples, we show that the same behavior is negligible among
  the accounts of regular users that the campaigns try to mimic. As its main substantive
  contribution, the paper demonstrates that online political astroturfing consistently
  leaves similar traces of coordination, even across diverse political and country
  contexts and different time periods. The presented methodology is a reliable first
  step for detecting astroturfing campaigns.
