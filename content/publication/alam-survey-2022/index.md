abstract: 'Recent years have witnessed the proliferation of offensive content online
  such as fake news, propaganda, misinformation, and disinformation. While initially
  this was mostly about textual content, over time images and videos gained popularity,
  as they are much easier to consume, attract more attention, and spread further than
  text. As a result, researchers started leveraging different modalities and combinations
  thereof to tackle online multimodal offensive content. In this study, we offer a
  survey on the state-of-the-art on multimodal disinformation detection covering various
  combinations of modalities: text, images, speech, video, social media network structure,
  and temporal information. Moreover, while some studies focused on factuality, others
  investigated how harmful the content is. While these two components in the definition
  of disinformation (i) factuality, and (ii) harmfulness, are equally important, they
  are typically studied in isolation. Thus, we argue for the need to tackle disinformation
  detection by taking into account multiple modalities as well as both factuality
  and harmfulness, in the same framework. Finally, we discuss current challenges and
  future research directions'
