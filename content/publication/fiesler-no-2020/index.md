abstract: Researchers from many different disciplines rely on social media data as
  a resource. Whereas some platforms explicitly allow data collection, even facilitating
  it through an API, others explicitly forbid automated or manual collection processes.
  A current topic of debate within the social computing research community involves
  the ethical (or even legal) implications of collecting data in ways that violate
  Terms of Service (TOS). Using a sample of TOS from over one hundred social media
  sites from around the world, we analyze TOS language and content in order to better
  understand the landscape of prohibitions on this practice. Our findings show that
  though these provisions are very common, they are also ambiguous, inconsistent,
  and lack context. By considering our analysis of the nature of these provisions
  alongside legal and ethical analysis, we propose that ethical decision-making for
  data collection should extend beyond TOS and consider contextual factors of the
  data source and research.
