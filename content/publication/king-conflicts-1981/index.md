abstract: The opportunities for research in the 1980s will be much affected by changes
  in society. In particular, by a clash between two powerful forces—the producer bureaucracy
  and the new individualism. It will be a clash of values and opinions; and research
  will be needed to measure them. However, there are dangers in the way that opinion
  research will be used, and especially in the way that it will be publicized. The
  protagonists in the arguments on many social issues are likely to make increasing
  use of published ‘research events’— that is, over-simplified and superficial figures
  on public opinion, designed mainly to appeal to the media's need for simple and
  dramatic news, and thence to affect public policies. In fact, the evidence is very
  strong that there is a genuine difference between people's private opinions and
  their public opinions. But the requirements of media contests will tend to force
  research methods to concentrate heavily on public opinions. The danger is not so
  much that this would distort social policies (though it might) as that it could
  damage the reputation of market research in general—especially if, as is likely,
  the findings of one group's ‘research events’ appeared to be directly opposed to
  those of another's. One important challenge of the 1980s will be to identify these
  risks and do something to guard against them. Five simple guidelines are suggested
  which I hope can contribute to a joint campaign to educate in the proper use and
  presentation of opinion research.
