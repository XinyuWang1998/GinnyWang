abstract: 'People can identify correspondences between narratives in everyday life.
  For example, an analogy with the Cinderella story may be made in describing the
  unexpected success of an underdog in seemingly different stories. We present a new
  task and dataset for story understanding: identifying instances of similar narratives
  from a collection of narrative texts. We present an initial approach for this problem,
  which finds correspondences between narratives in terms of plot events, and resemblances
  between characters and their social relationships. Our approach yields an 8% absolute
  improvement in performance over a competitive information-retrieval baseline on
  a novel dataset of plot summaries of 577 movie remakes from Wikipedia.'
