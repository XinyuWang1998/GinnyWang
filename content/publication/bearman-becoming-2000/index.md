abstract: This article illustrates a strategy for representing and analyzing narratives
  as networks. The strategy that we use considers narrative sequences as networks.
  Elements are treated as nodes which are connected by narrative clauses, represented
  by arcs. By representing complex event sequences as networks, inducing 'narrative
  networks', it is possible to observe and measure new structural features of narratives.
  The narratives we focus on are autobiographical accounts of becoming, and being,
  a Nazi. The substantive idea that we develop in this article is that the observable
  narrative structure of life stories can provide insight into the process of identity
  formation. We illustrate our approach to narrative networks by analyzing a single
  story that, in conjunction with the analysis of other stories, yields a set of insights
  into becoming and being. Â© 2000 Published by Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.
