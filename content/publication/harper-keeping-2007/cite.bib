 abstract = {This study examined the relationships between self-silencing and relational and individual functioning among adolescent romantic couples. Adolescent couples (N = 211) completed questionnaires and participated in a videotaped conflict interaction. High self-silencers reported conceding more to their partner during a conflict, poorer global communication within their romantic relationships, and greater experiences of depressive symptomatology. Partners of self-silencers reported more frustration and discomfort when interacting with the self-silencing member. Although significant actor and partner effects were not found between relationship satisfaction and self-silencing, correlation analyses by gender revealed a significant negative correlation between self-silencing and relationship satisfaction among adolescent girls. Self-silencing is related to multiple aspects of adolescent romantic relationships including communication patterns and the quality of relational and individual functioning.},
