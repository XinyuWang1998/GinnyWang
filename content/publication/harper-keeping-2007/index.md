abstract: This study examined the relationships between self-silencing and relational
  and individual functioning among adolescent romantic couples. Adolescent couples
  (N = 211) completed questionnaires and participated in a videotaped conflict interaction.
  High self-silencers reported conceding more to their partner during a conflict,
  poorer global communication within their romantic relationships, and greater experiences
  of depressive symptomatology. Partners of self-silencers reported more frustration
  and discomfort when interacting with the self-silencing member. Although significant
  actor and partner effects were not found between relationship satisfaction and self-silencing,
  correlation analyses by gender revealed a significant negative correlation between
  self-silencing and relationship satisfaction among adolescent girls. Self-silencing
  is related to multiple aspects of adolescent romantic relationships including communication
  patterns and the quality of relational and individual functioning.
