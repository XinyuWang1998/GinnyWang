abstract: This work uses a multivariate panel Granger causality test to examine the
  causal relationship between real international tourism receipts and economic growth
  in 11 Asian regions for the period from 1995 to 2015, accounting for both dependency
  and heterogeneity across regions. The results of this study support evidence for
  the growth hypothesis in the regions, such as Cambodia, China, and Malaysia. A reverse
  relationship supports evidence on the conservation hypothesis for the regions, such
  as Hong Kong, Indonesia, the Philippines, and South Korea. A reciprocal causal relationship
  was found in Macau and Singapore.
