abstract: Narratives represent a powerful and ubiquitous form of communication that
  influence what individuals believe about the world. While the field of narrative
  persuasion investigates how narratives affect attitudes and behaviors, it rarely
  considers structural variables discussed in the field of discourse psychology. This
  study examines the utility of bridging these fields by testing the persuasive influence
  of novel science information relative to the internal causal structure of a narrative.
  Results suggest that information placed at causal locations of a narrative result
  in greater acceptance of information than the same information placed at noncausal
  locations within the same narrative. These findings suggest that the within-narrative
  variable of causality can influence the persuasive impact of information inserted
  into a narrative. In response, this study identifies a significant source of variance
  that has thus far been overlooked in studies of narrative persuasion.
