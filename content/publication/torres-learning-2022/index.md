abstract: We provide an introduction of the functioning, implementation, and challenges
  of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to classify visual information in social
  sciences. This tool can help scholars to make more efficient the tedious task of
  classifying images and extracting information from them. We illustrate the implementation
  and impact of this methodology by coding handwritten information from vote tallies.
  Our paper not only demonstrates the contributions of CNNs to both scholars and policy
  practitioners, but also presents the practical challenges and limitations of the
  method, providing advice on how to deal with these issues.
