abstract: People might remain silent or give an opinion that is inconsistent with
  their private convictions when there is a divergence between their own views and
  the opinion voiced in their surrounding environment. This behavior suppresses the
  spread of weak opinions and affects the evolution of public opinion. Current opinion
  dynamics models do not fully consider this practice of attitude hiding. Thus, they
  are unable to reflect the phenomenon caused by individuals keeping silent. To solve
  this problem, based on online social networks, we propose an opinion dynamics model
  considering attitude-hiding behavior. Individuals perceive opinion climate based
  on feedbacks of expressions in history and use it to assess popularity of their
  newly opinions. They may keep silent and adjust expressible opinions to show obedience
  to the opinion climate. Experimental results and comparison with two related models
  indicate that our model can simulate the evolution of multiple public opinions associated
  with reality. Consequently, it provides a clearer explanation of the law and cause
  of the evolution of public opinion from the viewpoint of individualsâ€™ behaviors.
