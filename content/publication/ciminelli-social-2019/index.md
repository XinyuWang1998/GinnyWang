abstract: Our work is motivated by a desire to incorporate the vast wealth of social
  network data into the framework of spatial models. We introduce a method for modeling
  the spatial correlations that exist over a social network. In particular, we model
  attributes measured for each member of the network as a continuous process over
  the social space created by their connections. Our method simultaneously models
  the unobserved locations of network members in social space and the spatial process
  that exists over that space based on the observed network connections and nodal
  attributes. The model is evaluated through simulation studies and applied to the
  importance ranking for a network of emergency response organizations and the physical
  activity habits of teenage girls. The introduced methods incorporate network data
  into the spatial framework, expanding traditional models to include this often relevant
  source of additional information.
