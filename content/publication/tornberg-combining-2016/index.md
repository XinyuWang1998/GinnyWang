abstract: In this article we present an analysis of the discursive connections between
  Islamophobia and anti-feminism on a large Internet forum. We argue that the incipient
  shift from traditional media toward user-driven social media brings with it new
  media dynamics, relocating the (re)production of societal discourses and power structures
  and thus bringing about new ways in which discursive power is exercised. This clearly
  motivates the need to critically engage this field. Our research is based on the
  analysis of a corpus consisting of over 50 million posts, collected from the forum
  using custom web crawlers. In order to approach this vast material of unstructured
  text, we suggest a novel methodological synergy combining critical discourse analysis
  (CDA) and topic modeling – a type of statistical model for the automated categorization
  of large quantities of texts developed in computer science. By rendering an overview
  or ‘content map’ of the corpus, topic modeling provides an enriching complement
  to CDA, aiding discovery and adding analytical rigor.
