abstract: 'We are quickly passing through the historical moment when people work in
  front of a single computer, dominated by a small CRT and focused on tasks involving
  only local information. Networked computers are becoming ubiquitous and are playing
  increasingly significant roles in our lives and in the basic infrastructures of
  science, business, and social interaction. For human-computer interaction to advance
  in the new millennium we need to better understand the emerging dynamic of interaction
  in which the focus task is no longer confined to the desktop but reaches into a
  complex networked world of information and computer-mediated interactions. We think
  the theory of distributed cognition has a special role to play in understanding
  interactions between people and technologies, for its focus has always been on whole
  environments: what we really do in them and how we coordinate our activity in them.
  Distributed cognition provides a radical reorientation of how to think about designing
  and supporting human-computer interaction. As a theory it is specifically tailored
  to understanding interactions among people and technologies. In this article we
  propose distributed cognition as a new foundation for human-computer interaction,
  sketch an integrated research framework, and use selections from our earlier work
  to suggest how this framework can provide new opportunities in the design of digital
  work materials.'
