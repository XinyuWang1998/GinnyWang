 abstract = {Mining opinions and analyzing sentiments from social network data help in various fields such as even prediction, analyzing overall mood of public on a particular social issue and so on. This paper involves analyzing the mood of the society on a particular news from Twitter posts. The key idea of the paper is to increase the accuracy of classification by including Natural Language Processing Techniques (NLP) especially semantics and Word Sense Disambiguation. The mined text information is subjected to Ensemble classification to analyze the sentiment. Ensemble classification involves combining the effect of various independent classifiers on a particular classification problem. Experiments conducted demonstrate that ensemble classifier outperforms traditional machine learning classifiers by 3-5%.},
