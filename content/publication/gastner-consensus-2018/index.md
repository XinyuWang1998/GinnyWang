abstract: 'The voter model is a simple agent-based model to mimic opinion dynamics
  in social networks: a randomly chosen agent adopts the opinion of a randomly chosen
  neighbour. This process is repeated until a consensus emerges. Although the basic
  voter model is theoretically intriguing, it misses an important feature of real
  opinion dynamics: it does not distinguish between an agent’s publicly expressed
  opinion and her inner conviction. A person may not feel comfortable declaring her
  conviction if her social circle appears to hold an opposing view. Here we introduce
  the Concealed Voter Model where we add a second, concealed layer of opinions to
  the public layer. If an agent’s public and concealed opinions disagree, she can
  reconcile them by either publicly disclosing her previously secret point of view
  or by accepting her public opinion as inner conviction. We study a complete graph
  of agents who can choose from two opinions. We define a martingale M that determines
  the probability of all agents eventually agreeing on a particular opinion. By analyzing
  the evolution of M in the limit of a large number of agents, we derive the leading-order
  terms for the mean and standard deviation of the consensus time (i.e. the time needed
  until all opinions are identical). We thereby give a precise prediction by how much
  concealed opinions slow down a consensus.'
