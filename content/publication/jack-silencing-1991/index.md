abstract: 'Dana Crowley Jack offers startling new insights into the roots of female
  depression as she illuminates why women are far more likely than men to suffer major
  depression in adulthood. Silencing the Self is the first sweeping overview of depression
  in women that draws on new understandings of the importance of relationships in
  women’s lives. Attending closely to what depressed women have to say about their
  lives, Jack reframes major concepts of depression, freeing them from traditional
  models that have restricted our ability to listen to women’s perspectives on depression.
  Jack weaves these voices of depressed women directly into her discussion, providing
  new meanings to familiar themes: dependence, pleasing, anger, goodness, low self-esteem.
  These women clearly articulate a no-win, either/or tension in their lives, a tension
  between sacrificing their own needs in order to preserve a relationship and acting
  on their needs and feelings at the risk of losing the relationship. Their stories
  bring to light the “activity required to be passive”—the way women actively silence
  themselves in order to cultivate and maintain intimate relationships. To accommodate,
  they learn to censor themselves, to devalue their experience, to repress anger,
  to be silent. Examining moral themes in depressed women’s narratives, Jack demonstrates
  how internalized cultural expectations of feminine goodness affect women’s behavior
  in relationships and precipitate the plunge into depression. In a brilliant synthesis,
  Jack draws on myth and fairy tale for metaphors to further the understanding of
  depressed women. Silencing the Self makes a major contribution to the psychology
  of women by drawing from the recent literature on women’s relational self and detailing
  its relevance to female depression. This insightful approach to the dynamic of female
  depression forges new pathways to self-change, therapy, and research.'
