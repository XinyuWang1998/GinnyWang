abstract: 'This article extends the social identity model of deindividuation effects
  (SIDE) by considering the various ways in which relations of visibility to an audience
  can affect the public expression of identity-relevant norms (identity performance).
  It is suggested that social identity performance can fulfill two general functions:
  Affirming, conforming, or strengthening individual or group identities (the identity
  consolidation function) and persuading audiences into adopting specific behaviors
  (the mobilization function). The authors report evidence supporting these two functions
  of identity performance both in intragroup and intergroup contexts. They argue that
  through these functions, social identity performance plays a major role in the elaboration
  and coordination of social action. Finally, and building on this framework, the
  authors consider the ways through which social identity performance can be used
  in the very construction of social identity.'
