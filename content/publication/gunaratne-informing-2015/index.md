abstract: Can human-computer interaction help people make informed and effective decisions
  about their retirement savings? We applied the behavioral economic theories of endowment
  effect and loss aversion to the design of novel retirement saving user interfaces.
  To examine effectiveness, we conducted an experiment in which 487 participants were
  exposed to one of three experimental user interface designs of a retirement saving
  simulator, representing endowment effect, loss aversion and control. Users made
  34 yearly asset allocation decisions. We found that designs informed by the endowment
  effect and loss aversion theories and which communicated to savers the long-term
  implications of their asset allocation choices, led users to adjust their behavior,
  make larger and more frequent asset allocation changes, and achieve their saving
  goals more effectively.
