abstract: Heightened racial tensions during the COVID-19 pandemic contributed to the
  increase and rapid propagation of online hate speech towards Asians. In this work,
  we study the relationship between the racist narratives and conspiracy theories
  that emerged related to COVID-19 and historical stereotypes underpinning Asian hate
  and counter-hate speech on Twitter, in particular the Yellow Peril and model minority
  tropes. We find that the pandemic catalyzed a broad increase in discourse engaging
  with racist stereotypes extending beyond COVID-19 specifically. We also find that
  racist narratives and conspiracy theories which emerged during the pandemic and
  gained widespread attention were rooted in deeply-embedded Asian stereotypes. In
  alignment with theories of idea habitat and processing fluency, our work suggests
  that historical stereotypes provided an environment vulnerable to the racist narratives
  and conspiracy theories which emerged during the pandemic. Our work offers insight
  for ongoing and future anti-racist efforts.
