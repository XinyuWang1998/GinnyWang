abstract: For many applications measuring the similarity between documents is essential.
  However, little is known about how users perceive similarity between documents.
  This paper presents the ﬁrst large-scale empirical study that investigates perception
  of narrative similarity using crowdsourcing. As a dataset we use a large collection
  of Dutch folk narratives. We study the perception of narrative similarity by both
  experts and non-experts by analyzing their similarity ratings and motivations for
  these ratings. While experts focus mostly on the plot, characters and themes of
  narratives, non-experts also pay attention to dimensions such as genre and style.
  Our results show that a more nuanced view is needed of narrative similarity than
  captured by story types, a concept used by scholars to group similar folk narratives.
  We also evaluate to what extent unsupervised and supervised models correspond with
  how humans perceive narrative similarity.
