abstract: Food Literacy (FL) is associated with the improvement of autonomy and conﬁdence
  around food, healthier dietary intake, and chronic disease prevention. However,
  to date, behaviour change research at CHI has focused on motivating healthy eating
  mainly through weight loss and calorie control, which can lead to poor nutritional
  choices as consumers optimize caloric intake over a balanced diet. To address this
  gap, we designed a mobile game called Pirate Bri’s Grocery Adventure, that seeks
  to improve FL through a situated learning approach to grocery shopping. Our game
  leverages Self Determination Theory (SDT) to build a player’s competence, autonomy,
  and relatedness as shoppers are encouraged to develop an understanding of the nutritional
  beneﬁts of foods and are rewarded for balancing sugar, sodium, fats and ﬁbre in
  their purchases.
