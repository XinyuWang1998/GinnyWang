abstract: 'The wide availability of user-provided content in online social media facilitates
  the aggregation of people around common interests, worldviews, and narratives. However,
  the World Wide Web is a fruitful environment for the massive diffusion of unverified
  rumors. In this work, using a massive quantitative analysis of Facebook, we show
  that information related to distinct narratives––conspiracy theories and scientific
  news––generates homogeneous and polarized communities (i.e., echo chambers) having
  similar information consumption patterns. Then, we derive a data-driven percolation
  model of rumor spreading that demonstrates that homogeneity and polarization are
  the main determinants for predicting cascades’ size.The wide availability of user-provided
  content in online social media facilitates the aggregation of people around common
  interests, worldviews, and narratives. However, the World Wide Web (WWW) also allows
  for the rapid dissemination of unsubstantiated rumors and conspiracy theories that
  often elicit rapid, large, but naive social responses such as the recent case of
  Jade Helm 15––where a simple military exercise turned out to be perceived as the
  beginning of a new civil war in the United States. In this work, we address the
  determinants governing misinformation spreading through a thorough quantitative
  analysis. In particular, we focus on how Facebook users consume information related
  to two distinct narratives: scientific and conspiracy news. We find that, although
  consumers of scientific and conspiracy stories present similar consumption patterns
  with respect to content, cascade dynamics differ. Selective exposure to content
  is the primary driver of content diffusion and generates the formation of homogeneous
  clusters, i.e., “echo chambers.” Indeed, homogeneity appears to be the primary driver
  for the diffusion of contents and each echo chamber has its own cascade dynamics.
  Finally, we introduce a data-driven percolation model mimicking rumor spreading
  and we show that homogeneity and polarization are the main determinants for predicting
  cascades’ size.'
