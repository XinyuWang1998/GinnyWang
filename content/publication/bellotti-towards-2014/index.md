abstract: Commercial peer-to-peer service exchange businesses, such as AirBnB, Lyft
  and TaskRabbit, are expanding rapidly, but their non-profit counterparts are lagging
  behind. We conducted a field study of the most prominent of these, timebanking;
  a system in which ‘time dollars’ are earned and spent by people providing services
  for and receiving them from each other. Our study exposed problems with the very
  metaphor of banking itself, which deter participation. In this paper we discuss
  how these problems can be tackled with user experience design for systems supporting
  timebanking. Our design ideas emphasize the personal and social benefits of participation,
  and avoid such unappealing concepts as debt and neediness that the timebanking metaphor
  falls afoul of.
