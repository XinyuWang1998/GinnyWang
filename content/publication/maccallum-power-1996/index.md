abstract: 'A framework for hypothesis testing and power analysis in the assessment
  of fit of covariance structure models is presented. We emphasize the value of confidence
  intervals for fit indices, and we stress the relationship of confidence intervals
  to a framework for hypothesis testing. The approach allows for testing null hypotheses
  of not-good fit, reversing the role of the null hypothesis in conventional tests
  of model fit, so that a significant result provides strong support for good fit.
  The approach also allows for direct estimation of power, where effect size is defined
  in terms of a null and alternative value of the root-mean-square error of approximation
  fit index proposed by J. H. Steiger and J. M. Lind (1980). It is also feasible to
  determine minimum sample size required to achieve a given level of power for any
  test of fit in this framework. Computer programs and examples are provided for power
  analyses and calculation of minimum sample sizes. (PsycINFO Database Record (c)
