abstract: If designers and developers want to design better technologies that are
  intended for human use they need to have a good understanding of the people who
  are or who will be using their systems. Understanding people, their characteristics,
  capabilities, commonalities, and differences allows designers to create more effective,
  safer, efﬁcient, and enjoyable systems. This book provides readers with resources
  for thinking about people—commonly called ‘‘users’’—their tasks and the context
  in which they perform those tasks. Our intention is to enable you to make more informed
  decisions when designing complex interactive systems. This chapter thus introduces
  this argument through example design problems. We then present the beneﬁts and costs
  associated with understanding the user. Two approaches for understanding users are
  introduced. The ﬁrst is a framework called the ABCS for understanding, in broad
  strokes, different aspects of users. The second is user knowledge and action simulation
  for developing and testing how users approach tasks in more detail. After reading
  this chapter you should be able to appreciate why it is important to understand
  users, and the associated beneﬁts and costs of doing so.
