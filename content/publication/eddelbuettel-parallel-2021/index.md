abstract: 'Parallel computing has established itself as another standard method for
  applied research and data analysis. The R system, being internally constrained to
  mostly singly-threaded operations, can nevertheless be used along with different
  parallel computing approaches. This brief review covers OpenMP and Intel TBB at
  the CPU- and compiler level, moves to process-parallel approaches before discussing
  message-passing parallelism and big data technologies for parallel processing such
  as Spark, Docker and Kubernetes before concluding with a focus on the future package
  integrating many of these approaches. This article is categorized under: Algorithms
  and Computational Methods textgreater Methods for High Performance Computing Software
  for Computational Statistics textgreater Software/Statistical Software Software
