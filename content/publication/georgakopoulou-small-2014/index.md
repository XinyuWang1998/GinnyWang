abstract: In this article, I employ small stories research as a micro-perspective
  for the scrutiny of any crisis-related positionings of ‘Greece’ and ‘the Greeks’
  that accompany the circulation of news stories from Greece in social media. My claim
  is that such positionings cannot be fully understood without reference to what stories
  get circulated, where, by whom, for/with whom and how. To substantiate this, I draw
  on a particular incident involving the assault of two female MPs by a male MP on
  a Greek TV breakfast show (June 2012). My analysis will show that the ways in which
  the Greek crisis is invoked or disregarded and erased in the social media transpositions
  of the incident are intimately linked with two key-narrative processes, which I
  call narrative stancetaking and resemiotizations (i.e. video-based or text-based)
  that involve a rescripting of the initial incident. In both cases, I will show how
  processes of story making are important for what is signalled as relevant and for
  how the context of the Greek crisis is made sense of, critiqued and ultimately backgrounded
  or erased in favour of more personalized and localized interpretations, grounded
  in the original and the transposed tales and tellings.
