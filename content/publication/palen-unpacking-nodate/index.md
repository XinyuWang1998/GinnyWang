abstract: Although privacy is broadly recognized as a dominant concern for the development
  of novel interactive technologies, our ability to reason analytically about privacy
  in real settings is limited. A lack of conceptual interpretive frameworks makes
  it difficult to unpack interrelated privacy issues in settings where information
  technology is also present. Building on theory developed by social psychologist
  Irwin Altman, we outline a model of privacy as a dynamic, dialectic process. We
  discuss three tensions that govern interpersonal privacy management in everyday
  life, and use these to explore select technology case studies drawn from the research
  literature. These suggest new ways for thinking about privacy in sociotechnical
  environments as a practical matter.
