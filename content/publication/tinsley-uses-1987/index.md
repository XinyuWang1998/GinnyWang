abstract: Factor analysis is an analytic technique that permits the reduction of a
  large number of correlated variables to a smaller number of latent dimensions. The
  goal of factor analysis is to achieve parsimony by using the smallest number of
  explanatory concepts to explain the maximum amount of common variance in a correlation
  matrix. In this article, we provide an overview of factor analysis techniques. We
  provide a conceptual explanation of factor analysis, a discussion of the relation
  of factor analysis to other multivariate techniques, and an explanation of characteristics
  of the data to consider in determining the appropriateness of factor analysis. We
  review considerations in making decisions about communality estimates, methods of
  factor extraction, the number of factors to rotate, and methods of factor rotation.
  We conclude with suggestions on how to interpret factor analysis results, calculate
  factor scores, and report factor analysis results. (PsycInfo Database Record (c)
