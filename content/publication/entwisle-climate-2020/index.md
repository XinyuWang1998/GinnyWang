abstract: In popular accounts, stories of environmental refugees convey a bleak picture
  of the impacts of climate change on migration. Scholarly research is less conclusive,
  with studies finding varying effects. This article uses an agent-based model (ABM)
  of land use, social networks, and household dynamics to examine how extreme floods
  and droughts affect migration in Northeast Thailand. The ABM explicitly models the
  dynamic and interactive pathways through which climate-migration relationships might
  operate, including coupled out and return streams. Results suggest minimal effects
  on out-migration but marked negative effects on return. Social networks play a pivotal
  role in producing these patterns. In all, the portrait of climate change and migration
  painted by focusing only on environmental refugees is too simple. Climate change
  operates on already established migration processes that are part and parcel of
  the life course, embedded in dynamic social networks, and incorporated in larger
  interactive systems where out-migration and return migration are integrally connected.
