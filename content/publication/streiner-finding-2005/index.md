abstract: Path analysis is an extension of multiple regression. It goes beyond regression
  in that it allows for the analysis of more complicated models. In particular, it
  can examine situations in which there are several final dependent variables and
  those in which there are ?chains? of influence, in that variable A influences variable
  B, which in turn affects variable C. Despite its previous name of ?causal modelling,?
  path analysis cannot be used to establish causality or even to determine whether
  a specific model is correct; it can only determine whether the data are consistent
  with the model. However, it is extremely powerful for examining complex models and
  for comparing different models to determine which one best fits the data. As with
  many techniques, path analysis has its own unique nomenclature, assumptions, and
  conventions, which are discussed in this paper.
